# Credit_card_Dashboard

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing credit card transactions and customer data using MySQL for data extraction and Power BI for data visualization. The objective is to gain insights into transaction patterns, customer behavior, and other key metrics relevant to credit card usage.

Project Structure

The project is divided into the following key components:

Data Extraction (MySQL):

Credit Card Transactions: This dataset contains detailed information about each transaction made using credit cards, including transaction date, amount, merchant details, and more.
Customer Information: This dataset includes customer demographics, credit card details, and other relevant information.

Data Processing (MySQL):

Data cleaning and preprocessing were conducted to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the datasets.
SQL queries were used to aggregate and filter the data, focusing on key metrics like total transaction amount, number of transactions, average transaction value, and customer segmentation.

Data Visualization (Power BI):

Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards that visualize the key insights derived from the data.
The visualizations include:
Transaction Summary: Total transaction volume, total transaction value, and average transaction value over time.
Customer Segmentation: Analysis of customer behavior based on demographics, transaction patterns, and credit card usage.
Top Merchants: Identification of the most frequent merchants and the highest transaction volumes by merchant type.
Credit Card Performance: Analysis of different credit card products based on transaction activity and customer preferences.

Usage
Interactive Dashboards: Explore the Power BI dashboards to gain insights into credit card transaction patterns and customer behavior.
Reporting: Use the visualizations to generate reports that can be shared with stakeholders.

Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of credit card transactions and customer behavior, utilizing the power of MySQL for data processing and Power BI for data visualization. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform business decisions related to credit card products, customer segmentation, and marketing strategies.
